# What is Ruby?
Ruby is a simple and powerful object-oriented programming language, created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (who goes by the handle “Matz” in this document and on the mailing lists).

Like Perl, Ruby is good at text processing. Like Smalltalk, everything in Ruby is an object, and Ruby has blocks, iterators, meta-classes and other good stuff.

You can use Ruby to write servers, experiment with prototypes, and for everyday programming tasks. As a fully-integrated object-oriented language, Ruby scales well.

# Ruby features:

- Simple syntax,
- Basic OO features (classes, methods, objects, and so on),
- Special OO features (mixins, singleton methods, renaming, and so on),
- Operator overloading,
- Exception handling,
- Iterators and closures,
- Garbage collection,
- Dynamic loading (depending on the architecture),
- High transportability (runs on various Unices, Windows, DOS, macOS, OS/2, Amiga, and so on).

# Interpreted object-oriented programming language

Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. do not produce a binary executable file. (Compilers, the counterpart, translate the program to an executable binary code and then read it by the target machine)

# Object Oriented programming (OOP)

- It's a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
- It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code, usually called Classes (concepts of real life e.g: Person). Which are used to create individual instances of Objects (class instances ei: John).
